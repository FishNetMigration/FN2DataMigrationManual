# Fishnet 2 Data Migration Project

Author: Jeremy Holden 
Date: May 24, 2022  

The goal of this project is to document the workflow of migrating FN2 projects from the existing *DATA.ZIP* archive to a modern data product. The manual will outline tools for importing, cleaning and outputting a project or series of projects.

You can view the working copy of the manual online at: https://fishnetmigration.github.io/FN2DataMigrationManual/
