# About

The goal of this project is to document the workflow of migrating FN2 projects from the existing *DATA.ZIP* archive to a modern data product. The manual will outline tools for importing, cleaning and outputting a project or series of projects.

## Usage 

This manual will focus on the code and associated R packages used to migrate data.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'book.bib')
```
